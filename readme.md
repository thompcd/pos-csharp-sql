# Point of Sale Demo

This app was initially created by following the content of the Udemy course by covering [Point of Sale System Creations using C# and SQL](https://www.udemy.com/course/csharp-basic-and-advanced-creating-a-point-of-sale-system) and then further extended with additional features to practice feature development utilizing SQL database management.

This app is not production-hardened and is meant for demonstration only.
